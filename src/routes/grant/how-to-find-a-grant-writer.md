Find out the fee range in your community by asking other non-profit organizations. 

Ask for examples of the kinds of grants and organizations the consultant has worked with; try to make sure that your organization and grant need reasonably matches these. 

A. Know exactly what you are asking the consultant to do and what you expect the product to do for your organization. Is your organization: 
Responding to an existing RFP or application 
Developing a “boilerplate” proposal that must serve more than one purpose 
Needing help in identifying potential funding sources 
Putting together a development plan in which grant funding is one source of support

B. Try to have a sense of how complicated the grant will be to write. Do you: 
Have existing materials for the consultant to work from 
Have a clear and detailed idea of how to answer application questions 
Commit the board or other staff members who may be needed as part of the grant writing process.  Have the time to spend with the consultant during the grant 

C. Ask the consultant how long the project is expected to take; ask for a breakdown of tasks and how many hours will be dedicated to each. Ask the consultant about his or her grant writing style; ask the consultant to “walk through” what will happen during the process. 

D. Be clear about what you or your organization expects during the process—e.g., daily telephone reports, weekly meetings, every stage of the draft, work plans. Ask the consultant to be specific about deliverables and anticipated due dates. 

E. Ask the consultant for a written “Scope of Services” in advance of signing any contract.
 
Honestly assess the organization's “state of readiness” regarding grant writing in general or this grant in particular. The consultant's role should be to facilitate the flow and assembly of information and ideas and convert those into a compelling narrative; be aware of what you need is a consultant who can help generate and shape ideas, as well as shape the narrative. For example, it is one thing to ask a consultant to help you describe an outcome in measurable terms; it is another altogether to ask the consultant to suggest appropriate outcomes. 

F. Decide whether the consultant is serving as the project manager as well as the grant writer; that is, is the consultant managing the process of grant writing (e.g., convening meetings, gathering material, identifying data sources, etc.) in addition to writing the grant. 

G. Look to the “Consultant” section of the Management Assistance Program for Non-Profits    library for additional information: www.mapnp.org/library/index.html
