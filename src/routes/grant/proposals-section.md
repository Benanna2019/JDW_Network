**Request for Proposal (RFP)**

The purpose of this section is to guide you through the Request for Proposals (RFP) or grant application guidelines. Initially, you must analyze the RFP since it is your road map that outlines the requirements for consideration of your proposal. Try to avoid “bullshooto” or the extraneous information funding sources typically try to add to the application such as reference to laws. Focus more on specific items within the RFP that are needed to write the proposal. It is suggested that you develop an outline that documents the critical information. It has been our observation that up to 50% of grant proposals fail because the writer did not follow the RFP or missed small pieces outlined in the RFP that resulted in lost points. 

Begin by reading the RFP carefully several times. The following sections will outline the RFP.  Space is provided to organize this process or your notes and add any additional information.

1. **Problem Statement**

    The purpose of this section is to help you organize your problem statement to grab the reader’s attention. It is important to have a detailed but Focus more on specific items within the RFP that are needed to write the proposal. It is suggested that you develop an outline that documents the critical information.

    Make this section confirm you need as if you are an attorney presenting your case to a jury in a courtroom. Prove beyond a shadow of a doubt the seriousness of your problem! Remember to make the reviewer feel sorry for you!

2. **Program Approach**

    The purpose of this section is to help you develop your approach which is also referred to as the ministry and or project design or activities section so that the reviewer is clear as to how you plan to solve the problem. The program approach should outline exactly what you intend to do and tell a story in chronological order. It is important to define your goal and tie in program activities connected with the problem. After reading this section, the reviewer should not doubt what activities will take place and in what order. Remember that creating a new, innovative strategy will get the reader’s attention and interest. Show how your program is an “original.” Sale what your program has to offer!

3. **Goals & Objectives**

    The purpose of this section is to help you organize your goals and objectives so that the reviewer knows “exactly” what you plan to accomplish. Goals convey to the reader what your overall mission is, while objectives provide more concise, specific ways your program activities should be measured. Objectives are also the minimum outcomes you plan to accomplish. You must develop your goals and objectives based on your program approach or strategy section. Never develop your objectives until your approach section is complete. This will keep the reviewer focused, reduce confusion, and enhance flow. Remember to let the reviewer know what you want to attain in the future and how you will reach your criteria.

4. **Evaluation**

    The purpose of this section is to help you organize and write your program evaluation. Conducting an evaluation is important to measure the quality of your program and how well you performed. Evaluation is a way to determine the degree to which your program is meeting its goals and objectives. Remember to show the reviewer how your evaluation will ensure that outcomes are in line with your goals and objectives. Having a solid evaluation system is important to prove that your program was successful and needed and that the program should be continued in the future. Your program cannot exist without some evaluative method. It should only be written once the program approach and objectives have been completed.

5. **TimeLines**

    The purpose of this section is to guide you in developing your timelines. The timeline lets the reviewer know when program activities will take place by using dates and periods. The timeline provides detailed, concise, and chronological information on program and administrative activities. Once again, use your program approach section as a guide as to what to include in your timeline. All activities mentioned in your program approach should be reflected in your timeline. Also, there should not be any “new” information in the timeline that has not been mentioned previously. 

    This section can also be useful as a planning tool once your grant has been funded. Consequently, whenever you think you can accomplish an activity, add 1-2 months to your expectations to be sure you can comply. Remember that many unexpected problems can delay your expectations so be realistic. After reading your timeline, the reviewer should not doubt when and what time periods your program activities will encompass.

6. **Exportable Product**

    The purpose of this section is to help you organize what should be included in the exportable product. The exportable product documents the program’s weaknesses and strengths describe the program, and exports knowledge learned from the grant program from the grant writer to others locally, statewide, or nationally. The exportable product is an important element in your grant. It details the specific products you plan to develop in your grant. Reviewers are impressed when the proposal shows how it will document success and failures and share information with other people and professionals. This section usually is not as long as other sections of the proposal. Remember to convey to the reviewer that you will be giving something in return to the public for the funding.

7. **Conclusion**

    The purpose of this step is to help you organize your conclusion statement. The conclusion provides the reader with a short restatement of the problem and what you plan to do about it. It gives a very general overview of everything you have presented in your proposal. The conclusion is one of the shortest sections of a proposal and includes just a few sentences to wrap up your approach. Remember that this section is the last of the narrative that the reviewer may read in your proposal. Leave this section on a positive note and with a smile on your face!

8. **Budget**

    This section outlines the very basic components of a grant proposal budget. It is suggested that you take Developing Successful Grants and/or Developing Successful Grant Budgets for a more detailed description of formulating budgets. A model budget is provided at the end of this section to help you start constructing your budget.

    The budget lets the reviewer know how you will be spending your money and how much your program costs. The budget must include a line item description of each component supported by detailed information on how you calculated the cost of each line item. Also, document the program purpose for each expenditure or why the expenditure is important for your program. The limit of the amount of your grant should be reflected in the RFP. The budget should be tied to your program narrative. Remember the budget is sometimes reviewed by a budget analyst who may “not” read the program of your grant proposal. Consequently, be very detailed and ensure that the budget can be reviewed alone. The reviewer should be able to read your budget and tell if your proposal will be funded or not. A poorly constructed budget will undermine the funding chances of an exceptional program!

9. **Ministry and or ministry and or ministry and or project Summary**

    The purpose of this section is to help you organize your ministry and or ministry and or ministry and or project summary. The ministry and or ministry and or ministry and or project summary should be a brief overview of your entire grant proposal. It should contain “concise” statements to introduce or get the reader started on what you will be proposing. The ministry and or ministry and or ministry and or project summary is one of the first ways to bond with the reader. Do not go into too much detail in this section. The ministry and or ministry and or ministry and or project summary is similar to an abstract or overview section and should be written last. However, it is the first section of your proposal. Remember that the ministry and or ministry and or ministry and or project summary is probably one of the first sections the reviewer will read so make it look and sound good!

10.	**Proposal Format**

    The purpose of this section is to provide you with a checklist for your proposal format. Considering the appropriate format for your proposal is very important. A sloppy and messy appearing proposal will turn off reviewers and make them not want to read your ideas no matter how good they are. The type of proposal you hand in may give a lot of indirect clues to the reviewer as to how organized your program will be. Make the appearance of your proposal neat and eye-catching. Put some time into the format and make your proposal look good! Remember you should always follow the format specifications in the RFP exactly if there are any.
