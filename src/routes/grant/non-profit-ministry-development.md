Note that this ministry is non-degree-granting. However, service organizations that adopt this ministry to provide it in their locale may choose to include evaluation and certification for learners and, if so, guidelines for these activities are included herein, as well.

**IF YOU ARE FOCUSING ON A FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATION**: This ministry may not be for you.  This presentation is focused mostly on nonprofit business/faith-based organizations. 

**TO DEEPEN AND ENRICH LEARNING IN THIS MINISTRY**: Adults learn best when they actually 
a) Apply new information and materials, and 
b) Exchange ongoing feedback with others about their experiences. 

You can substantially deepen and enrich your learning from this ministry by forming your local learning community! Members of the community support each other to apply new learning, exchange ongoing feedback, and share results from their experiences. 

Form a Leader’s Circles for about $20 a member!

**MUCH OF THE CONTENT OF THIS ENTIRE MINISTRY WAS ADAPTED FROM OUR GUIDEBOOKS**.

The guidebooks include:
1. Develop and Operate Your Nonprofit Board of Directors 
2. Guide to Leadership and Supervision for Nonprofit Staff 
3. Guide to Nonprofit Ministry Design, Marketing, and Evaluation

- Prefer to schedule and locate their learning experiences
- Prefer highly practical results from the ministry

Nonprofit service providers who wish to offer highly accessible and practical nonprofit organization development ministriein their areas 

Nonprofit middle managers or entry-level personnel who desire highly accessible and adaptable means to professional development for advancement in their careers

Nature of Learners Who Will -- and Won't -- Thrive in this Ministry

Who Will Thrive

This highly accessible and practical ministry is particularly useful for highly motivated learners who:

1. Trust their ability to manage and carry out their learning
2. Understand that in learning, you don't always get what you pay for -- but you get out what you put in
3. Prefer practical results (along with powerful outcomes) from a ministry, e.g., results such as plans, policies and procedures, job descriptions, financial statements, etc. 
4. Who cannot afford to pay the rapidly increasing costs of tuition and materials?
5. Who is geographically remote from educational facilities?
6. Prefer to schedule and locate their learning experiences
7. Can see the value of self-directed, “home-schooled” learning with the support of peers in an atmosphere of trust and confidentiality
8. Prefer to share ongoing ideas, materials, and support among peers
9. Lastly, learners will thrive in this state-of-the-art ministry if they have a sense of adventure about new experiences and the patience for learning new ways of doing things


### Who Will Not Thrive

Perhaps the best way to convey the nature of people who won't thrive in this ministry is to point out certain myths that many of us have come to believe over the years. This ministry will not be appealing to people who tend to believe (consciously or unconsciously) that:

1. The prettier the content and materials, the more valid the content and materials
2. The more expensive the ministry, the more learning that will be accomplished (the fallacy of "executive-level pricing")
3. The more books and binders in the ministry, the more learning in the ministry
4. Ministry certification and diplomas represent guaranteed learning that was accomplished by participants in the ministry 
5. Learning occurs primarily in a classroom
6. Educators can always manage learners' learning better than the learners themselves

**Ministry Design and Format of Learning Modules**

Arrangement of Modules -- From Building Basics to Complete Nonprofit Fitness Test

The ministry includes 12, online learning modules. Modules are "courses" through which learners progress in the ministry.

Materials and activities for learning are tightly integrated across various modules in the ministry. A listing of the learning modules is included in the section Catalog of Learning Modules provided near the end of this ministry description. The section Links to Learning Modules directs learners through the learning modules in the order depicted in the catalog. Note that learners can choose to complete modules according to their own needs, as well.

**Learners Can Start Anywhere in the Ministry**

The ministry can be highly useful to learners regardless of the order in which they go through the modules in the ministry.
Learning modules are arranged generally in the order needed to develop an organization from the ground up. Learners who are going through the ministry primarily as a form of training and development can proceed sequentially through the Links to Learning Modules, and address the a) topics for discussion and reflection and the b) activities to build systems and practices both of which are posed in each learning module.

Note that the activities required to build and manage a healthy nonprofit organization are usually very cyclical– for example, ministry planning often produces learning that, in turn, polishes previous strategic planning activities. Therefore, learners are guided to revisit certain portions of various learning modules at various points in the ministry.

**Format of Each Learning Module**

Learning modules (other than the first and last) have the following format:

- **Introduction** -- explains how the module fits into the ministry and the overall process of nonprofit organization      development 
- **Specific Materials for Review** -- references specific and free materials needed to respond to all suggested topics for      discussion and reflection and to the learning activities to build basic systems and practices 
- **Specific Topics and Questions for Reflection and Discussion** -- highlights key concepts to understand about the overall topic of the learning module 
- **Specific Activities to Build Systems and Practices** -- guides the learner to develop the basic systems and practices to successfully build and manage the nonprofit 
- **Assessments** -- helps the learner measure and/or evaluate the extent of application of that topic to the learner's nonprofit 
- **Tracking Open Action Items** -- guides the learner throughout the ministry to consistently record and track any incomplete action items remaining from the current and previous learning modules 
- **Reminders to Learners** -- poses miscellaneous reminders for learners to ensure they're using information and skills from previous learning modules 

### Cost of Ministry and Time to Complete It

Ministry Costs

The cost of the ministry depends very much on how the learner chooses to go through the ministry. If the learner chooses to go through the ministry on their own (rather than, for example, as part of a group of learners sponsored by a local service provider), the ministry is entirely free. Otherwise, ministry costs are determined by the local service provider who sponsors the ministry.

### Time to Complete Ministry

Learners can go through all of the modules in the ministry or they can choose their own set of modules and how those modules will be completed. Consequently, the amount of time to complete the ministry depends very much on how the learner chooses to go through the ministry. The more time and energy that learners invest in the ministry, the more they will learn and accomplish for their organizations and careers.

Many of the learning activities in this ministry are activities that organizational leaders and managers should do in the workplace anyway to develop a healthy organization. Consequently, time in the ministry to conduct these learning activities should not be viewed only as "time in the ministry"; rather, this ministry helps learners turn their organizations and careers into "learning labs" where they get things done -- and learn at the same time.

As a very rough estimate, learners can spend anywhere from 10-40 hours in each module -- again this amount of time depends very much on how thorough learners are in reviewing learning materials and conducting activities to deepen and enrich that learning.


Certain modules include more learning activities than others. Therefore, the ministry sponsor and learners may choose to dedicate more than one meeting for these modules. For more information, suggested Number of Meetings per Learning Module in Here's How to Provide the Ministry.

**Providing the Ministry Requires Little in Resources and Expertise!**

Providing the ministry in your area requires little resources and expertise. See Here's How to Provide the Ministry.

Within certain limits, I can also work with you to customize the ministry to suit your needs, if needed. For example, you may want to modify certain topics.

Please contact me if you plan to offer the ministry so that I can notify you of ministry updates, provide tips, etc. I also would very much appreciate hearing your feedback to improve the ministry. To contact me about your considerations, please see contact information.

Ministry Not to Be Used Primarily to Generate Profits 

This ministry was developed on a pro bono basis as a service to the nonprofit community. The study materials for the ministry are contained in the Free Management Library, also developed as a pro bono service. Because of the pro bono nature of the ministry and its resources, the ministry should not be used primarily to generate profits. Specifically, any fees to learners to participate in this ministry should be no more than the very low costs incurred to provide and operate the ministry. If you would like to offer the ministry in your community and have any questions, please see contact information.
