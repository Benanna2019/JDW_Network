No development officer can afford to overlook any source of major gifts -- including grants. Yet, busy fundraising executives, today find it nearly impossible to actively pursue grants without hiring a full-time professional. That means paying another salary and benefits, plus the cost of finding the right individual. Add to that higher office overhead, more secretarial support, another computer system along with costly research directories, and the cost quickly escalates to $75,000 to $100,000 a year.

### Mission

The mission of The JDW Network is to help small businesses and nonprofit agencies in their quest to become self-sufficient.   Established in 2002, as NP Marketing, The JDW Network specializes in effective management and resource development. We assist clients not only in building effective business plans but also in board training and development, fiscal and marketing plans, as well as technological applications to maximize agency potential.

**A COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE**

The JDW Network is a not-for-profit, 501 C3 consulting ministry that specializes in securing funding for small business and non-profit organizations. Our mission is to help small businesses and nonprofit agencies in their quest to become self-sufficient. We function as a "virtual" grants department by using the most up-to-date communication technology to bridge the distance between our clients and us anywhere in the country. This enables us to save thousands of dollars for our clients, the cost to create their in-house program. Although our fee is minimal, our services are of the highest caliber. Unlike many grant consultants who offer only proposal writing services, we work side by side with our clients each step of the way in the grant development process with our full range of management and resources development services.

**HOW IT WORKS**

**Client Needs Assessment**

We begin with a visit to your location to quickly identify your current and future grant-eligible needs.

This comprehensive on-site assessment usually takes a day to complete and involves a series of individual and group interviews. We augment this with a review of your existing promotional materials including mission statement, strategic plan, annual report, as well as previously submitted grant applications.

**Funders Database**

Based on the information collected from the needs assessment process, we begin to search our extensive database of grantmakers to match your needs with the giving interests of over 50,000 private and corporate foundations, hundreds of federal agencies, state funding programs, and other often overlooked sources. In addition, we also search international funders whose funding histories support causes similar to those of our clients. When linked with an effective resource development plan, our database enables client agencies to market themselves to appropriate funding institutions in a turnkey process whereby we manage client correspondence.

The JDW Network actively monitors all of the funders in the United States as well as international funders whose funding histories support causes similar to those of our clients. When linked with an effective resource development plan, our database enables client agencies to market themselves to appropriate funding institutions in a turnkey process whereby we manage client correspondence. 

**Strategy Development**

Once we have identified the funding prospects most likely to respond to your needs, we develop a strategy tailored to meet the unique requirements of each grantmaker. This is based on our up-to-date information obtained through contact with the grantmakers, review of tax records, and other organizations they have recently supported. 

**Grant Proposal Preparation**

Our next step is to prepare grant proposals for submission to multiple funding sources. However, unlike many grant seekers who resort to a one-proposal-fits-all strategy, we individually craft your proposals to meet the unique needs of each grantmaker. This targeted approach greatly enhances your potential for success. A non-targeted approach often leads to rejection and diminishes any chance of future funding.

As experienced professionals, we know what grantmakers look for in fundable proposals. We carefully prepare each proposal with a complete needs statement, project narrative, goals and objectives, projected outcomes, evaluation methodology, budget, and capabilities of your organization and the individuals who will manage the funded project.

We also include any required documents and addenda material together with a cover letter and executive summary fully prepared, proofed, edited, and sent to you ready for your approval, CEO signature, and mailing.

**Proposal Tracking and Monitoring**

Unlike many grant consultants, our services do not end with the submission of a proposal. We continue to serve our clients by monitoring each proposal through the various stages of a grant maker's review process. We also respond to each grant maker's request for additional information to further support your proposal.

**Post Grant Follow-up**

Once you have been awarded a grant, we work with you to prepare reports to the grantmaker advising them of your progress with the funded project. Most consultants do not offer this service.  Yet this is a crucial step to building long-term relationships with any grantmaker that often leads to future support.

**Ongoing Needs Assessment**

We maintain regular personal contact to keep you fully informed of our actions and to learn of your changing needs so we can continue to help you achieve funding success. We also act as your information source to detect new grant opportunities and funding sources that busy development officers can easily overlook.

**Opportunity You Can Afford**

Our full range of services is available to clients who wish to engage us to aggressively search out grants over 12 months. Our fee is a fixed annual retainer payable in monthly installments based on the number of grant-eligible projects requiring funding and the complexity of written proposals. The annual fee ranges approximately one-sixth of the amount necessary for a client to create its own in-house grants department and employ a full-time professional.

We will perform grant writing, research, or other services on an individual basis for a flat fee that varies with the type of service and the extent of the work required. We do not work on a contingency basis nor do we accept fees based on a percentage of grant dollars secured.

**SERVICES PROVIDED**

Business Plan Development, Market Plan Development, Board Training and Development, Business Startups and Turnarounds, Human Resource Management, Technology Applications, Grant Writing, Grant Development, Internet Consulting, Risk Management, Fiscal Management, and Volunteer Training 

**FEES YOU CAN AFFORD**

The JDW Network works on a retainer basis so there are no large cost surprises. Each retainer is previously agreed upon before consultation with the client and is made in monthly installments.

Follow-up Work

Did you know that most grant proposals are rejected because they are poorly written, not because of bad ideas? Learn to write winning grant proposals. Don't make the common mistake that most make when requesting sources for grant money. They have the sources and information but know what to do with the information. Or make simple errors that get their applications rejected or proposals disqualified. 

Most grants require that you write a presentation of the idea, need, or project for which you are requesting funding. There is so much competition for grant money that grantors are looking for reasons to reject proposals and narrow the possible recipients. You need to do it right the first time, because there may not be a second chance. 

If you are serious about applying for grants, then this will be a helpful writing tool. How you write your proposal may make the difference between getting approved or not. Get It Today!
