Coalition: Board Development Survey<a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a>


Each question asks about how the Community Coalition board is performing in several areas that are known to be important for coalition success.

For each question, respond using the 1 to 5 scale described below. Circle the number that best matches your feelings. For each question, if you think the question does not apply to the board, circle NA (for not applicable) instead of circling a number. **This survey is anonymous and the results will be analyzed in aggregate. Please do not place your name on this survey.**

**The scale: 1------2------3------4------5   NA**

1. Board rarely or never meets this standard. (Needs to be done)

2. Board mostly does not meet this standard. (Starting but needs more work)

3. Board sometimes mets this standard (Doing okay, but room for improvement)

4. Board usually meets this standard (Actively working on this, and have improved)

5. Board always or almost always meets this standard (We are there!)

- N/A - This question doesn't apply to this board
