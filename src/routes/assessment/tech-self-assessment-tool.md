## Introduction

This administrator technology self-assessment tool is the collaborative effort of the Charleston County Department of Education and the State's Educational Technology Advisory Council (ETAC). The purpose of developing this sample tool is to assist superintendents, principals, and other administrators in their leadership role of implementing appropriate technology in their schools. This tool was developed by adapting the Technology Standards for School Administrators developed as part of the National Educational Technology Standards (NETS). NETS is an initiative of the International Society for Technology Education (ISTE). The NETS Technology Standards for School Administrators are: 

I. Leadership and Vision
II. Learning and Teaching
III. Productivity and Professional Practice
IV. Support, Management, and Operations
V. Assessment and Evaluation
VI. Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues

We collapsed the six NETS standards into the following three strands for the development of this self-assessment tool.

We hope that this sample tool will help administrators make appropriate decisions regarding their own professional development needs and that it will assist them in their leadership role in their schools and districts. 

I. Basic Technology Skills: 

_Educational leaders demonstrate technology proficiency and apply technology to enhance their professional practice and increase their productivity and that of others._

II. Leadership Skills: 

_Educational leaders inspire a shared vision and plan for the comprehensive integration of technology in their schools. They understand that technolgy can support productive systems for teaching and learning, assessment, evalutation, and administration; and they ensure the implementation of their technology plan. The integration of technology includes curricular design, instructional strategies, and learning environments that maximize teaching and learning._
