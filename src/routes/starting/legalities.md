Your nonprofit organization can be recognized by your donors as a tax-exempt entity in as little as 120-160 days with the help of the JDW Network. 501(c)(3) status provides certain incidental benefits including: 

- Public recognition of tax-exempt status. 
- Advanced assurance to donors of deductibility of contributions. 
- Exempt from certain state taxes and federal excise taxes. 
- Nonprofit mailing privileges, etc. 

The benefits of federal tax-exempt status are truly amazing. Call us today! With a short interview, we begin working for you. Prices start as low as $599 for the 501(c)(3) application.

Churches, schools, hospitals, and medical research, homes for the aged or handicapped, private operation foundations, and childcare are just a few eligible for the 501(c)(3)status.

We know that there are a lot of questionable companies out there who will fill out your IRS 1023 and other forms for a fee - a word of caution: many times these companies have little or no experienced staff and no formal training. The sad news is that you'll probably only know the real talent of the firm that you use after several long months of waiting. You can only imagine the disappointment of such a long wait only to be denied status and face starting all over. Be smart. Use an experienced lawyer with trained staff.
